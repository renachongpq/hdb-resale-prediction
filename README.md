## Limitations & Future Improvements
The current set of features used for housing price prediction can be expanded futher to include other features that buyers take into consideration when looking to purchase a HDB flat. For example, the proximity of HDB flats to public transportation (specifically, MRT stations) is an important factor that a significant number of buyers consider when buying a HDB flat. Accesibility to amenities such as supermarkets, shopping malls and eateries may also affect the price of resale flats. Incorporating more features that buyers take into consideration is likely to be able to improve the accuracy of resale flat price predictions.

Futhermore, the nature of the dataset is time series data, hence traditional time series forecasting methods such as ARIMA can be explored to compare its accuracy to forecasting using machine learning.
